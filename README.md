# Code Climate Style Guides

A consistent style is important in a code base. Inconsistency greatly increases
the number of inconsequential decisions developers must make. Consistency is
good for readability and a clean code base promotes keeping a code base clean
(i.e. Broken Window Theory). It is more important, and ultimately will make you
happier, to abide by a defined style and end up in a consistent code base, than
to code in your own preferred style and not.

Any PR comments regarding violations of the guidelines here should be addressed
immediately and without discussion. If you disagree with a guideline, propose a
change in a PR to this repo. Once the team has settled on a guideline, it must
be followed.

Existing code may be fixed for style if, and only if, it must be touched in the
course of your current work. Do not change code *only* to fix style.

## Terminology

- **Do**, **don't**, etc: these must be followed always
- **Avoid**/**prefer**: if not following these, the burden is on you to convince
  your reviewer why
